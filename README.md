# Scriban Syntax Coloring extension for Visual Studio Code

This extension allows to colorize Scriban scripts and Scriban-Html scripts following the syntax of the [scriban templating language](https://github.com/lunet-io/scriban)

## Features

The syntax coloring supports two modes:

- Plain **scriban scripts**, not embedded in HTML with the expected file extensions:
  - `.scriban`
  - `.sbn`
- Mixed **scriban and HTML** with the expected file extensions:
  - `.scriban-html`
  - `.scriban-htm`
  - `.sbn-html`
  - `.sbn-htm`
  - `.sbnhtml`
  - `.sbnhtm`
